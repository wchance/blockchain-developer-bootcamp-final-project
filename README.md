Project Title: Native Token Swap

The idea of this project is to build a dApp that allows users to exchange native ETH Token (Ethereum Mainnet) for native MATIC Token (Polygon Mainnet) or ETH Token (Optimistic Ethereum) utlizing metamask wallet.  We will specialize in Native token transfer in order to help users save on swap transfer fees.  Once the user is on Polygon Network or Optimism Network they can take advantage of lower fees.

1.  User will navigate to dApp https://app.nativeswap.com
2.  User will connect wallet (MetaMask) on Ethereum Mainnet
3.  User will be able to swap from ETH (Ethereum Mainnet) to MATIC (Polygon Mainnet)
4.  ETH will be deposited in Ethereum Smart Contract.
5.  MATIC will be withdrawn from Polygon Smart Contract.
